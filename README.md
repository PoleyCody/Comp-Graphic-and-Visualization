1.	How do I approach designing software? 

When designing software my main focus is on the requirements of the client ensure the product is what the client needs and wants. After focusing on the requirements, I focus on the security of the program ensuring that the code is safe for the client. The new skill I have gained from working on the project are learning how to use OpenGL and how to plot in a 3D space. In truth this is the first time I have worked on OpenGL, and I found it interesting. When completing this project, I focused more on creating the objects in the 3D space then I worried about the textures and colors.   

2.	How do I approach developing programs? 

While developing the project I used a new strategy rather than coding the program as I go, I used a pencil and paper to graph out what the scene will look like. After drawing out what the scene will look like I plotted the objects, and I used this information to code the scene. Iteration was a major factor in my project because of the graphing involved in creating the objects for the scene. My approach changed throughout the project from focusing on the big picture to focusing on the objects and the scene then coming back to the big picture.  

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

By learning Computational graphics and visualizations I learn new skills and in how to create graphics and the work that goes into creating them. The skills I have learned will help me to focus more on the design of my programs and how it works. This will ensure I focus on the details of the program and ensure I create better programs. Iâ€™m not sure how this will affect my professional path by I feel knowing how they are created will give me insight into the development of better programs.
